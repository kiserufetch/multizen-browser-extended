 * Remove the workspace symlink directory before electron-builder packs.
 *
 * Yarn 4 with nodeLinker:node-modules creates symlinks under
 *   apps/desktop/node_modules/@multizen/*
 * pointing to packages/<x>/. electron-builder follows those symlinks
 * and refuses to package "package.json under a path outside the app"
 * with the error:
 *   "packages/<x>/package.json must be under apps/desktop/"
 *
 * Workspace packages are already bundled into out/main/index.js by
 * electron-vite (see NATIVE_EXTERNALS in electron.vite.config.ts;
 * @multizen/* is NOT in that list, so rollup inlines them). The
 * symlinks have served their purpose by the time this script runs.
 *
 * Cross-platform: uses fs.rmSync, no shell tools.
